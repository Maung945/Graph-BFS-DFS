For this lab, you will test out the depth-first search and breadth-first search code that was presented in class.  
To test out the code, you will use the provided text files, 
which contain two graphs, one with 25 nodes and the other with 100 nodes.  
You can either read the graphs from file or hard code the nodes into the program.  
In the text files, the first value is the number of nodes in the graph and the second value is the starting node.  
All other values are in pairs, which represent undirected edges.  
Execute the DFS and BFS programs using the provided graphs and output the results.  
The DFS and BFS code can be found on the Source Code page in Canvas.
